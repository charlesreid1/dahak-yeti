docker:
- docker is not installed
- with and without docker?  (short cloud-init url at charlesreid1.com?)
- add user to docker group
- add user to sudo group
- etc etc

dotfile problems:
- git s does not work
- stupid "back" being inserted when I do ctrl+b
- arrow keys in vim - already mentioned.

vim syntax:
- .rule, .settings, and .snakefile and etc - syntax highlight with snakemake highlights, add .vim to repo
- left arrow right arrow in insert mode inserts C

vim helpers:
- syntax highlighting ok
- need better helpers and bundling

dotfile repo organization:
- allows adding color schemes
- separate common dotfile components for each machine into components
- submodules is definitely the way to go here.
